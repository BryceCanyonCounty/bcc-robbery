# bcc-robbery

## Description
> This script allows players to initiate heists with a simple command, defend against enemy NPCs, and earn valuable rewards from carefully crafted locations. With configurable settings and a version check feature, our script provides a seamless and immersive gaming experience

## Features
- Configurable command for players to enable or disable shooting a gun to start a robbery!
- Create as many custom robberies as you want!
- Individual robbery location cooldowns!
- Cash, gold, rol, and item rewards from robberies!
- Each robbery location, can have as many loot boxes as you want!
- Togglable option to have enemy npcs spawn, and attack the player during the robbery!
- Configurable wait time before the player can lockpick loot boxes!
- Ability to disable robberies for certain jobs!
- Config option to alert police when someone starts a robbery!
- Version check to help you keep up to date on updates!

## How it works!
- Enter the command you set in the config to enable robberies. Then when you are near a valid robbery location shoot your gun to start it!
- Once you have started a robbery you will need to wait out the timer, and defend yourself from enemy npcs if you enabled them.
- Once the timer has ran out you can begin lockpicking the loot boxes to gain rewards!
- If you enabled police alerts you will want to make haste as the cops will be on thier way!
